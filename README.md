# cafe-billing-system

In this program, we have a Menu class that represents the menu items available in the cafe, and an Order class that represents the items ordered by the customer. The program allows the user to select items from the menu and adds them to the order. It then displays the order details and calculates the total amount of the order. The program uses a simple console interface for input and output.
